I have recently read somewhere that Japan has lowered (or is trying to lower) the voting age because they don't have enough people who care enough to vote. Young people, on the other hand, just came out of schools where they learnt subjects on politcs, so that they still care a bit more. And that is where politicians were trying to get votes from. I think that it could be dangerous in this sense that young people might be strongly affected by what they learnt about politics at school (which might not be right) without proper observation or experience of how the society really works.",
